# Calibration-of-interest-rate-models-using-EM-algorithm
Calibration of Vasicek model in a Hidden Markov Model Setting. 
The code contains calibration of equity index models in a Hidden markov setting using Expectation Maximisation algorithm
Calibration is carried out for 2 state, 3 state and 4 state cases. 
The equity index is assumed to follow a Vasicek Model with regime switching probabilities.
